Advanced Duplicate File Finder for Python.


Installation
------------

Type in your command shell **with _administrator/root_ privileges**:

    pip install deplicate[full]

In Unix-based systems, this is generally achieved by superseding
the command `sudo`.

    sudo pip install deplicate[full]

The option `full` ensures that all the optional packages will downloaded and
installed as well as the mandatory dependencies.

You can install just the main package typing:

    pip install deplicate

If the above commands fail, consider installing with the option
[`--user`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#user-installs):

    pip install --user deplicate
